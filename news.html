		<h3>Project discontinued</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Unfortunately, the Party Game Viewer has been discontinued.  This is because Twitch has started to show purple screens in embeds, making this inconvenient to use.  Other current streaming platforms like have opted to allow only limited embedding, and others do not allow embedding at all, making this unusable for those platforms.  As a result of this, I have officially decided to discontinue this, and there will be no further updates.</li>
