# The Party Game Viewer
A nice stream/game viewer for watching streams of and playing Jackbox Games and similar games.  This is still in its very early stages.  [See it here!](http://decimic.github.io/partygameviewer)

## What does the Party Game Viewer do?
I like playing Jackbox Games with streamers.  While you can play games on your mobile devices, I prefer playing on the computer.  What was painful about it that I had to keep switching tabs between the stream and the game, and sometimes I end up missing the opportunity to answer something because I was on the stream tab and not the game tab.  I did try putting my browser windows side-by-side, but that made the stream so tiny unless I condensed the chat, which I don't want to do because I want to see the chat as well.  Popping out the stream and chat can also be tedious.  I made this mainly for myself, so I would be able to play the Jackbox games while seeing the stream and chat at the same time, so I wouldn't miss something.
